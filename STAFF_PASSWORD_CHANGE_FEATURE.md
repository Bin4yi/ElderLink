## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **`backend/controllers/profileController.js`**

**Added:**

- Import `bcrypt` module
- New function: `changeStaffPassword`
  - Validates current password and new password
  - Verifies user is staff role
  - Compares current password with stored hash
  - Updates password (hashed by User model hook)
  - Updates `lastPasswordChange` timestamp

**Key Implementation:**

```javascript
exports.changeStaffPassword = async (req, res) => {
  // Validates input
  // Verifies current password
  // Sets new password (User model hook hashes it)
  user.password = newPassword;
  user.lastPasswordChange = new Date();
  await user.save();
};
```

**Security Notes:**

- ✅ Password is **NOT** manually hashed in controller
- ✅ User model's `beforeUpdate` hook handles hashing automatically
- ✅ This prevents the double-hashing bug
- ✅ Minimum 6 characters required
- ✅ Current password verification required

#### 2. **`backend/routes/profile.js`**

**Added:**

- New route: `PUT /api/profile/staff/password`
- Route handler: `profileController.changeStaffPassword`
- Protected by `authenticate` middleware

---

### Frontend Changes

#### 3. **`frontend/src/services/profileService.js`**

**Added:**

- New function: `changeStaffPassword(passwordData)`
- Endpoint: `PUT /profile/staff/password`
- Returns success/error response

**Usage:**

```javascript
await changeStaffPassword({
  currentPassword: "current123",
  newPassword: "newPassword123",
});
```

#### 4. **`frontend/src/components/staff/profile/Profilestaff.js`**

**Added:**

- Import `X` icon from lucide-react
- Import `changeStaffPassword` from profileService
- State: `showPasswordModal` (boolean)
- State: `passwordForm` (object with currentPassword, newPassword, confirmPassword)
- Function: `handlePasswordChange` - handles form submission and validation
- UI: "Change Password" button in header card
- UI: Password change modal with form

**Features:**

- ✅ Beautiful gradient modal design matching the header
- ✅ Current password field
- ✅ New password field (min 6 chars)
- ✅ Confirm password field
- ✅ Client-side password match validation
- ✅ Toast notifications for success/error
- ✅ Form resets after successful change
- ✅ Modal closes on cancel or success

## User Experience

### How to Change Password:

1. **Navigate** to Staff Profile page
2. **Click** "Change Password" button (top right with shield icon)
3. **Enter** current password
4. **Enter** new password (at least 6 characters)
5. **Confirm** new password
6. **Click** "Change Password" to submit
7. **Receive** success/error notification

### Validation Rules:

- ✅ All fields required
- ✅ Current password must match existing password
- ✅ New password minimum 6 characters
- ✅ New password and confirmation must match
- ✅ Cannot use current password as new password (bcrypt handles this naturally)

### Error Messages:

- "Current password and new password are required"
- "New password must be at least 6 characters"
- "New passwords do not match"
- "Current password is incorrect"
- "Failed to change password"

### Success Message:

- "Password changed successfully!" (green toast)

## Security Features

### ✅ Password Hashing

- **User Model Hook**: Automatically hashes passwords on update
- **Algorithm**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **No Double-Hashing**: Controller passes plain text, model hashes once

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization

- JWT token required
- Staff role verification
- Current password validation

### ✅ Input Validation

- All fields required
- Minimum length enforcement
- Password confirmation matching

### ✅ Security Best Practices

- Passwords never logged
- Generic error messages (no password leakage)
- Timestamp tracking (`lastPasswordChange`)
