    {
      model: User,
      as: 'familyMember',
      attributes: ['id', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'email']
    }
  ]
});

// Send email
try {
  const appointmentDate = new Date(completeAppointment.appointmentDate);
  const emailData = {
    familyMemberEmail: completeAppointment.familyMember?.email || req.user.email,
    familyMemberName: `${firstName} ${lastName}`,
    elderName: `${elder.firstName} ${elder.lastName}`,
    doctorName: `${doctor.user.firstName} ${doctor.user.lastName}`,
    appointmentDate: appointmentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
      weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric', month: 'long', day: 'numeric' 
    }),
    appointmentTime: appointmentDate.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', { 
      hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', hour12: true
    }),
    reason: completeAppointment.reason,
    type: completeAppointment.type || 'consultation',
    duration: completeAppointment.duration || 30,
    zoomJoinUrl: completeAppointment.zoomJoinUrl
  };

  await emailService.sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail(emailData);

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
EMAIL_FROM=ElderLink <noreply@elderlink.com>
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Gmail Setup:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate App-Specific Password
3. Use app password in `EMAIL_PASSWORD`

---

## Error Handling

### Email Service:
```javascript
try {
  await emailService.sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail(emailData);
  return { success: true, messageId: info.messageId };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('❌ Email failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
  // No throw - allows appointment creation to continue
}
```

### Controller:
```javascript
try {
  await emailService.sendAppointmentConfirmationEmail(emailData);
  console.log('✅ Email sent');
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('⚠️ Email failed:', emailError);
  // Continue - appointment still created
}
```

**Philosophy**: Email failure should NOT prevent appointment creation. The appointment is the primary goal; email is a notification enhancement.

});

  foreignKey: 'elderId',
  as: 'elder'
});

Appointment.belongsTo(Doctor, {
  foreignKey: 'doctorId',
  as: 'doctor'
});
```
